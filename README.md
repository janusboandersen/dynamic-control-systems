# Quadrotor: Dynamic Systems and Control
This repo contains files for the control project for the course E4DSE (Dynamiske Systemer og Regulering).
The project is dynamic modeling of a quadrotor, and design, implementation and test of flight controllers.

The project uses methods from classical and modern control, leveraging linear algebra throughout.

All `.slx` files are Simulink files for simulation of the linear and nonlinear system in various dimensions.
The pdf file contains the main report, documenting the methods, the math, the results and learnings/future improvements.
